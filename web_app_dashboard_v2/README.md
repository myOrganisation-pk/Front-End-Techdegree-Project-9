# Front-End-Techdegree-Project-9
Web App Dashboard

This is the ninth project for the TeamTreehouse FrontEnd Techdegree.

This project is a social media site mockup page with several different examples of real world functionality. 
The user can click alerts, search for users, use the charts, and save settings.

The page was designed with a mobile first responsive layout in mind, with viewports tailored for both mobile and larger screen sizes.

Total time spent working on the project was approximately 18 days.
